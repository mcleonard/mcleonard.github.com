    "# Implementing Probabilistic Matrix Factorization in PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "I found myself wanting to learn more about models for recommendation systems. After a bit of digging, I found what appears to be one of the better options for [collaborative filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering) called Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF). What really excited me about this particular model is that it is a pretty straightforward Bayesian model. Also, implementing it with PyTorch would be quite fun. I'll outline the idea of PMF in this post, you can read more [in the original paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/3208-probabilistic-matrix-factorization.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to use the MovieLens dataset [from here](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). This dataset has movie ratings from a number of different users. There are different sizes provided, but I'll use the smallest dataset to keep things simple. The dataset I'm using has a bit over 100,000 ratings from 610 users, for 9724 movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this model, we want to predict for our users which movies they'll like. We can do this by finding feature vectors for our users and movies. The vectors are learned from users' ratings and encode each users movie preferences as well as hidden information about the movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use those feature vectors to compare users and movies. Users with similar feature vectors should have similar tastes in movies, so we can make recommendations that way. Movies with similar feature vectors should have similar qualities such as being in the same genre. Again, we can use these movie features to make recommendations because if movie A and movie B are similar, then a user who loves movie A should also love movie B. Finally, we can take the inner product of a user's feature vector and a movie's feature vector to calculate an estimated rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "![matrix factorization](https://i.imgur.com/JiQepKO.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a big matrix $R$ of movie ratings, with users as rows and movies as columns. Since users don't rate all movies, this is a pretty sparse matrix with a lot of missing values. What we can do is factor $R$ into two matrices $U$ and $V$ representing latent feature vectors for users and movies. With these latent features, we can compare users with each other, movies with each other, and predict ratings for movies users haven't seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The big idea behind this paper is that we're going to treat the latent vectors as parameters in a Bayesian model. As a reminder, Bayes theorem:\n",

    "\\large \\hat{R} = U^T V \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In our model we assume the ratings are drawn from a normal distribution with mean $\\hat{R}$. What's really cool is that we can place priors on our latent features. \n",

    "$$\n",

    "The authors of the paper go further and build a hierachical structure for the user vectors that takes into account users with low numbers of reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "U_i &= Y_i + \\frac{\\sum_k^M I_{ik} W_k}{\\sum_k^M I_{ik}} \\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "The authors also do things like converting the ratings to be between 0 and 1, then taking the sigmoid of $U^T V$. For empirical reasons."
